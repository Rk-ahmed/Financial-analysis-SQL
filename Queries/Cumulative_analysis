/* Explanation:
PARTITION BY AccountID, Type calculates cumulative sums separately for each account and transaction type (Income or Expense).

ORDER BY TxnDate ensures the running total respects chronological order.

ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING means the sum includes all previous rows up to the current one. */
